# HandTracker
# WINDOWS ONLY

# Uses mediapipe to capture hand in each frame and then uses hand coordinates to perform relative calculations based on hand/finger position to control mouse.

# The tip of the middle finger controls the mouse cursor, the responsiveness of the cursor is a function of the hand's distance from the screen so as to implement more rigid cursor control when the hand is further away and less certain to the code.



#BASIC CURSOR CONTROLS

-RING FINGER DOWN THEN UP (RIGHT CLICK)
